# Quantity Measurement App  
## UC6 – Addition of Two Length Units (Same Category)
---
**Date:** 20 Feb 2026  
---

## Overview

UC6 extends the Quantity Measurement App by introducing addition operations between two length measurements belonging to the same measurement category (Length).

This use case builds directly on:

- UC3 – Generic Quantity model (DRY principle)  
- UC4 – Extended unit support (Feet, Inches, Yards, Centimeters)  
- UC5 – Explicit unit-to-unit conversion API  

UC6 enables arithmetic addition of two `QuantityLength` objects, even when they are expressed in different units, and returns the result in the unit of the first operand.

---

## UC6 Objectives

- Enable arithmetic addition for length quantities  
- Support addition across different length units  
- Preserve immutability of value objects  
- Reuse centralized conversion logic (no duplication)  
- Maintain mathematical correctness and precision  
- Validate inputs and handle edge cases safely  

---

## Supported Units

- Feet (ft)  
- Inches (in)  
- Yards (yd)  
- Centimeters (cm)  

All units belong to the same measurement category: **Length**.

---

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Value Object Pattern

- `QuantityLength` represents a physical length  
- Immutable: operations return new instances  
- Encapsulates value + unit + behavior  

### 2. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

- All conversions normalize via a single base unit (inches)  
- UC6 reuses UC5 conversion infrastructure  

### 3. Abstraction & Encapsulation

- Conversion logic hidden inside domain objects  
- Clients interact only through clean APIs (`add()`, `convertTo()`)  

### 4. Immutability

- Original operands remain unchanged  
- Prevents side effects and improves predictability  

---

## Addition Logic (How UC6 Works)

1. Validate inputs:
   - Operands must not be null  
   - Values must be finite numbers  
   - Units must be valid length units  

2. Convert both operands to the base unit (inches)

3. Add the converted values

4. Convert the sum back to the unit of the first operand

5. Return a new `QuantityLength` object

---

## Example Scenarios

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1 ft + 2 ft | 3 ft |
| 1 ft + 12 in | 2 ft |
| 12 in + 1 ft | 24 in |
| 1 yd + 3 ft | 2 yd |
| 36 in + 1 yd | 72 in |
| 5 ft + 0 in | 5 ft |
| 5 ft + (-2 ft) | 3 ft |

---

## Application Flow

1. User provides two values with units  
2. Quantities are created using `QuantityLength`  
3. Addition is performed using `add()`  
4. Result is returned in the unit of the first operand  
5. Equality checks (UC3+) continue to work unchanged  

---

## Test Coverage (UC6)

The UC6 test suite validates:

### Same-Unit Addition

- Feet + Feet  
- Inches + Inches  

### Cross-Unit Addition

- Feet + Inches  
- Inches + Feet  
- Yards + Feet  
- Centimeters + Inches  

### Mathematical Properties

- Commutativity: a + b = b + a  
- Identity element: adding zero  
- Negative value handling  

### Precision & Accuracy

- Floating-point tolerance (epsilon based)  
- Round-trip conversion safety  

### Validation & Error Handling

- Null operand rejection  
- Invalid input handling  
- Large and small value addition  

---

## Concepts Learned in UC6

- Arithmetic operations on value objects  
- Unit normalization before arithmetic  
- Immutability in domain models  
- Conversion reuse across features  
- Floating-point precision handling  
- Mathematical property validation (commutativity)  
- Clean API design for domain operations  

---

## Forward Compatibility

With UC6 implemented, the system is now ready for:

- Subtraction, multiplication, division (UC7+)  
- Support for additional measurement categories  
- Mixed-category validation (length vs weight, etc.)  
- Enhanced arithmetic APIs  

---

## Summary

UC6 completes the transition from simple equality checks to full-fledged arithmetic operations on quantities.

The Quantity Measurement App is now:

- Generic  
- Scalable  
- Mathematically correct  
- Cleanly designed  
- Fully test-driven
