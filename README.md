## UC4 – Extended Unit Support (Yards & Centimeters)
**Date:** 20 Feb 2026  
---

## Overview

UC4 extends the generic design introduced in UC3 by adding support for two additional length units: `YARDS` and `CENTIMETERS`.

Since UC3 introduced a unified `QuantityLength` class backed by the `LengthUnit` enum, new units can now be added without modifying the core equality logic. This demonstrates the scalability, maintainability, and extensibility of the refactored architecture.

The system now supports seamless equality comparison across:

- Feet
- Inches
- Yards
- Centimeters

---

## UC4 Objectives

- Extend support for `YARDS` and `CENTIMETERS`
- Maintain zero code duplication
- Preserve all functionality from UC1, UC2, and UC3
- Enable full cross-unit equality comparison
- Validate scalability of enum-based design

---

## Conversion Rules Introduced

- 1 Yard = 3 Feet  
- 1 Yard = 36 Inches  
- 1 Centimeter = 0.393701 Inches  

All conversions are internally handled using a common base unit (inches).

---

## Changes Introduced in UC4

###  No Core Logic Modified

- No changes to `QuantityLength`
- No changes to `equals()` implementation

###  Updated

- `LengthUnit` enum extended with:
  - `YARDS`
  - `CENTIMETERS`

This confirms the system follows the Open-Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).

---

## Supported Functionality

- Yard ↔ Yard equality  
- Centimeter ↔ Centimeter equality  
- Yard ↔ Feet equality  
- Yard ↔ Inches equality  
- Centimeter ↔ Inches equality  
- Centimeter ↔ Feet equality  
- Multi-unit transitive comparisons  
- Same-reference equality  
- Null-safe comparison  
- Type-safe unit validation  

---

## Application Flow

1. User inputs two numeric values and their respective units.
2. Unit input is converted into a `LengthUnit` enum.
3. `QuantityLength` objects are created.
4. Values are converted internally to the base unit (inches).
5. Equality is evaluated using value-based comparison.
6. Result (`true` / `false`) is displayed to the user.

---

## Example Execution

Input: `Quantity(1.0, YARDS)` and `Quantity(3.0, FEET)`  
Output: `Equal (true)`

Input: `Quantity(1.0, YARDS)` and `Quantity(36.0, INCHES)`  
Output: `Equal (true)`

Input: `Quantity(1.0, CENTIMETERS)` and `Quantity(0.393701, INCHES)`  
Output: `Equal (true)`

Input: `Quantity(2.0, YARDS)` and `Quantity(2.0, YARDS)`  
Output: `Equal (true)`

---

## Testing Strategy

All previous UC1–UC3 test cases continue to pass.

### Additional Test Coverage Includes:

- Yard-to-yard equality  
- Yard-to-feet equivalence  
- Yard-to-inches equivalence  
- Centimeter-to-inches equivalence  
- Multi-unit transitive property validation  
- Invalid unit rejection  
- Null unit handling  
- Same-reference comparison  

This confirms that the system remains stable and backward compatible.

---

## Key Concepts Applied

### Scalability
Adding new units requires only enum modification.

### DRY Principle Validation
No separate class created for Yards or Centimeters.

### Enum Extensibility
Type-safe addition of new measurement units.

### Mathematical Accuracy
Precise conversion factors ensure reliable cross-unit equality.

### Backward Compatibility
Existing functionality remains unaffected.

### Transitive Property
If A = B and B = C, then A = C.

Example:  
1 Yard = 3 Feet  
3 Feet = 36 Inches  
Therefore → 1 Yard = 36 Inches  

---

## Forward Compatibility

UC4 prepares the system for:

- Adding more units (meters, kilometers, etc.)
- Implementing arithmetic operations
- Extending the measurement domain
- Scaling without architectural changes
