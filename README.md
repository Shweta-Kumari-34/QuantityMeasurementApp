- This branch contains the implementation of the **Feet** class.  
- It demonstrates how a single unit of measurement is compared with itself before comparing with other units.

###  Feature 1 – Define Single Unit (FEET)

Worked on defining a single unit of measurement **[FEET]** and implemented equality logic.

###  Implementation Details

- Developed a `Feet` class.
- Overrode `equals()` method from the `Object` class.
- Checked if both objects refer to the same memory reference (`this == obj`).
- Checked if the object is `null` or of a different type.
- Safely cast the object to `Feet` type.
- Compared double values using `Double.compare()` instead of `==` operator.
- Followed clean coding principles.

###  Testing

- Wrote test cases to model real-world scenarios.
- Modified implementation based on test case results.
- Ensured correctness and reliability of equality behavior.

### 📌 Repository Updates
- Committed and pushed the UC1 implementation to the repository.
