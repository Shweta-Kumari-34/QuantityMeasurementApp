# Quantity Measurement App  
## UC-8 – Refactoring Unit Enum to Standalone with Conversion Responsibility
---
**Date:** 21 Feb 2026  
---

## Overview

UC8 refactors the Quantity Measurement App to improve architecture quality, scalability, and adherence to SOLID principles.

In UC1–UC7, unit conversion logic was embedded inside the `QuantityLength` class. While functional, this approach tightly coupled quantity behavior with unit knowledge, making the system harder to extend to new units or measurement categories.

UC8 resolves this by extracting all unit conversion responsibility into a standalone `LengthUnit` enum, making it the single source of truth for unit-related behavior.

All features from UC1 to UC7 remain fully backward compatible.

---

## UC8 Objectives

- Decouple unit conversion logic from quantity objects  
- Enforce the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
- Improve readability and maintainability  
- Enable easy scalability for future measurement categories  
- Preserve existing behavior without changing client code  

---

## Preconditions

- `QuantityLength` class exists from UC3–UC7  
- Supported length units:
  - FEET  
  - INCHES  
  - YARDS  
  - CENTIMETERS  
- A consistent base unit is defined (FEET)  
- Arithmetic and comparison operations are limited to the length category  
- Unit tests from UC1–UC7 are already implemented  

---

## Design Changes Introduced in UC8

### Removed from QuantityLength

- Embedded unit conversion logic  
- Hardcoded conversion factors  
- Responsibility for unit-to-unit translation  

### Added / Refactored

#### LengthUnit (Standalone Enum)

- Owns all conversion logic  
- Converts:
  - Values to base unit  
  - Values from base unit  
- Acts as a reusable conversion strategy  

#### QuantityLength

Refactored into a pure immutable value object.

Responsibilities limited to:

- Holding value and unit  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Equality comparison  
- Delegating conversion to `LengthUnit`  

---

## Updated Responsibilities

| Component        | Responsibility |
|------------------|---------------|
| LengthUnit       | Unit conversion logic |
| QuantityLength   | Value operations (equals, add, convert) |
| EqualityService  | Cross-unit equality comparison |
| App              | User interaction / execution entry point |

---

## Main Flow

1. Client creates `QuantityLength(value, unit)`  
2. Conversion requests are delegated to `LengthUnit`  
3. For arithmetic operations:
   - Convert operands to base unit  
   - Perform operation in base unit  
   - Convert result to target unit  
4. A new immutable `QuantityLength` object is returned  

---

## Supported Operations (UC1–UC8)

### Equality (UC3 / UC4)

- Same-unit equality  
- Cross-unit equality  
- Reflexive, symmetric, and transitive behavior  

### Conversion (UC5)

- Explicit unit-to-unit conversion  
- Base-unit driven conversion  
- NaN and Infinite value validation  

### Addition – Implicit Target (UC6)

- Result unit defaults to first operand unit  

### Addition – Explicit Target (UC7)

- Result unit explicitly specified by client  
- Supports all valid length units  

---

## Testing Strategy

UC8 introduces refactor-validation tests while retaining all existing test cases.

### Test Coverage Includes

- Conversion to base unit correctness  
- Conversion from base unit correctness  
- Delegation from `QuantityLength` to `LengthUnit`  
- Equality consistency after refactor  
- Addition and conversion regression tests  
- Immutability validation  
- Backward compatibility verification for UC1–UC7  

All existing tests pass without modification, confirming the refactor is safe and behavior-preserving.

---

## Concepts Reinforced in UC8

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Units manage conversion  
- Quantities manage behavior  

### Encapsulation

- Conversion logic hidden inside enum  
- Clean and minimal public APIs  

### Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

- New units added by extending enum only  
- No changes required in quantity classes  

### Immutability

- All operations return new objects  
- Thread-safe by design  

### Architectural Scalability

Pattern directly extensible to:

- WeightUnit  
- VolumeUnit  
- TemperatureUnit  

---

## Example Outputs

Input: `Quantity(1.0, FEET).convertTo(INCHES)`  
Output: `Quantity(12.0, INCHES)`

Input: `Quantity(1.0, FEET).add(Quantity(12.0, INCHES), FEET)`  
Output: `Quantity(2.0, FEET)`

Input: `Quantity(1.0, FEET).add(Quantity(12.0, INCHES), YARDS)`  
Output: `Quantity(0.667, YARDS)`

Input: `Quantity(36.0, INCHES).equals(Quantity(1.0, YARDS))`  
Output: `true`

---

## Forward Compatibility

With UC8 implemented:

- Adding a new unit requires only enum extension  
- Adding a new measurement category requires a new unit enum  
- No refactor required for `QuantityLength`  
- System remains clean, extensible, and maintainable  

---

## Conclusion

UC8 elevates the Quantity Measurement App from a functional implementation to a well-architected, scalable system.

It demonstrates:

- Strong object-oriented design  
- Practical refactoring skills  
- Industry-grade architectural thinking  

UC8 serves as the architectural backbone for all future enhancements.
