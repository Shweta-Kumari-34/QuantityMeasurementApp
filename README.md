#  Quantity Measurement App  

## UC9 – Weight Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition  
**(Kilogram, Gram, Pound)**  
---
**Date:** 18 Feb 2026  
---
##  Overview  

UC9 extends the **Quantity Measurement App** by introducing a new measurement category: **Weight**.

Building on the scalable architecture from UC8, this use case demonstrates that the system can support multiple independent measurement categories **without modifying existing code**.

Weight measurements operate independently from length measurements and support:

- Equality comparison  
- Unit conversion  
- Arithmetic addition  

All weight-related logic follows the same design principles used for length measurements, ensuring architectural consistency, scalability, and maintainability.

---

##  UC9 Objectives  

- Introduce Weight as a new measurement category  
- Support multiple weight units with accurate conversion  
- Enable cross-unit equality comparison  
- Support arithmetic addition  
- Enforce category type safety (Length ≠ Weight)  
- Reuse UC8’s enum-based conversion architecture  
- Preserve UC1–UC8 functionality without regression  

---

##  Preconditions  

- UC1–UC8 fully implemented and passing  
- Enum-based unit conversion architecture in place  

### Supported Weight Units  

| Unit | Symbol | Conversion |
|------|--------|------------|
| Kilogram | kg | Base Unit |
| Gram | g | 1 kg = 1000 g |
| Pound | lb | 1 lb = 0.453592 kg |

All conversion factors are defined relative to the base unit (Kilogram).

---

## Design Additions in UC9  

###  WeightUnit (Enum)

Responsible for:
- Defining weight units  
- Holding conversion factors  
- Converting to base unit (kg)  
- Converting from base unit  

Mirrors the structure of `LengthUnit`.

---

###  QuantityWeight (Immutable Value Object)

Encapsulates:
- Numeric value  
- WeightUnit  

Supports:
- Equality comparison  
- Unit conversion  
- Addition  

All conversion logic is delegated to `WeightUnit`.

---

##  Architectural Responsibility  

| Component | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| WeightUnit | Weight unit conversion logic |
| QuantityWeight | Weight behavior (equals, add, convert) |
| LengthUnit | Length conversion (unchanged) |
| QuantityLength | Length behavior (unchanged) |
| EqualityService | Category-safe comparison |

---

## Main Flow  

###  Equality Comparison  
- Convert both values to base unit (kg)  
- Compare normalized values  
- Return `true` / `false`

###  Unit Conversion  
- Convert source value to base unit  
- Convert base unit to target unit  
- Return new immutable object  

###  Addition  
- Convert both operands to base unit  
- Add values  
- Convert result to:
  - First operand’s unit (default)  
  - Or explicitly specified target unit  
- Return new immutable object  

---

##  Supported Operations  

### Equality  
- Same-unit equality  
- Cross-unit equality (kg ↔ g ↔ lb)  
- Reflexive, symmetric, transitive behavior  

### Conversion  
- Explicit unit-to-unit conversion  
- Base-unit normalization  
- Floating-point precision handling  

### Addition  
- Same-unit addition  
- Cross-unit addition  
- Explicit target unit support  
- Handles zero and negative values  
- Prevents logical and mathematical errors  

---

##  Testing Strategy  

All UC1–UC8 tests remain untouched and passing.  

### Test Coverage Includes:

- Kilogram-to-kilogram equality  
- Gram-to-gram equality  
- Pound-to-pound equality  
- Cross-unit equality:
  - Kilogram ↔ Gram  
  - Kilogram ↔ Pound  
- Conversion accuracy  
- Addition (same and different units)  
- Explicit target unit conversion  
- Zero and negative values  
- Immutability validation  
- Length vs Weight incompatibility  
- HashCode consistency  

All tests pass without modifying earlier use cases.

---

##  Concepts Reinforced  

- Multiple Measurement Categories  
- Enum-Based Responsibility Assignment  
- Base Unit Normalization  
- Category Type Safety  
- Immutability  
- Thread-Safe Design  
- Scalable Architecture  

---

##  Forward Compatibility  

With UC9 implemented:

- New weight units can be added easily  
- New measurement categories (Temperature, Volume, Time) can be introduced  
- Existing functionality remains unchanged  
- Architecture scales cleanly  

---

##  Conclusion  

UC9 proves that the Quantity Measurement App has evolved into a multi-domain, scalable measurement system.

It demonstrates:

- Clean separation of concerns  
- Strong object-oriented modeling  
- Extensible architecture  
- Real-world refactoring maturity  

This implementation lays the foundation for future enhancements and domain expansion.
