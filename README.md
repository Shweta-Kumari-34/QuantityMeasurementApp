#  Quantity Measurement App  

## UC11 – Volume Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition  
*(Litre, Millilitre, Gallon)*  
**Date:** 21 Feb 2026  
---

##  Overview  

UC11 extends the Quantity Measurement App to support a third measurement category: **Volume**, alongside Length and Weight.

Thanks to the generic architecture introduced in UC10, volume support is added **without modifying**:

- `Quantity<U>`  
- `IMeasurable`  
- Existing Length or Weight logic  
- Existing tests for UC1–UC10  

UC11 validates that the system is truly scalable, generic, and future-proof.

---

##  UC11 Objectives  

- Introduce Volume as a new measurement category  
- Support:
  - Equality comparison  
  - Unit conversion  
  - Addition (implicit & explicit target unit)  
- Ensure volume remains non-interoperable with length and weight  
- Prove UC10’s generic design works without refactoring  
- Maintain full backward compatibility (UC1–UC10)  

---

##  Supported Volume Units  

| Unit | Symbol | Conversion to Base (LITRE) |
|------|--------|----------------------------|
| Litre | L | 1.0 |
| Millilitre | mL | 0.001 |
| Gallon (US) | gal | 3.78541 |

**Base Unit: LITRE**

---

##  Preconditions  

- UC10 generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` is fully implemented  
- `IMeasurable` interface is stable  
- `LengthUnit` and `WeightUnit` already implement `IMeasurable`  
- All UC1–UC10 tests are passing  
- No category-specific Quantity classes exist  

---

#  Design Changes in UC11  

##  Added  

### VolumeUnit (Enum)
- Implements `IMeasurable`  
- Holds only conversion factors  
- Base-unit normalization via LITRE  
- Parsing helper for console input  

---

##  Not Added (Intentionally)

- No `QuantityVolume` class  
- No changes to `Quantity<U>`  
- No changes to `IMeasurable`  
- No changes to Length or Weight logic  

This confirms UC10 scalability.

---

##  Main Flow  

1. User selects Volume category  
2. User enters values and volume units  
3. Application creates:
   - `Quantity<VolumeUnit>`  
4. Operations performed:
   - Equality  
   - Conversion  
   - Addition  

All logic is handled by the generic `Quantity` class.

---

##  Supported Operations (UC11)  

### Equality  

- Same-unit equality  
  - `1 L == 1 L`  
- Cross-unit equality  
  - `1 L == 1000 mL`  
- Transitive, symmetric, reflexive  
- Cross-category comparison returns false  

---

### Unit Conversion  

- Any volume unit → any volume unit  
- Uses LITRE as base unit  
- Round-trip precision preserved within epsilon  

---

### Addition  

#### Implicit Target Unit  
- Result unit = first operand’s unit  

#### Explicit Target Unit  
- Result unit specified by caller  

All operations return new immutable `Quantity` objects.

---

##  Category Safety  

`Quantity<VolumeUnit>` cannot be compared with:

- `Quantity<LengthUnit>`  
- `Quantity<WeightUnit>`  

- Compile-time safety via generics  
- Runtime check in `equals()` ensures isolation  

---

##  Testing Strategy  

### Test Coverage Includes:

- Litre–Litre equality  
- Litre–Millilitre equality  
- Litre–Gallon equality  
- Conversion across all unit pairs  
- Addition with same and different units  
- Explicit target-unit addition  
- Volume vs Length incompatibility  
- Volume vs Weight incompatibility  
- Zero, negative, and large values  
- Immutability validation  
- Precision and rounding behavior  

All UC1–UC11 tests pass without modifying existing test logic.

---

##  Concepts Reinforced in UC11  

- Generic Scalability  
- Open–Closed Principle  
- DRY Principle  
- Type Safety via Generics  
- Immutability  
- Architecture Validation  

UC10 design is proven correct in real extension.

---

##  Conclusion  

UC11 confirms that the Quantity Measurement App is now:

- Fully generic  
- Easily extensible  
- Architecturally sound  
- Production-ready  

The system scales linearly, not exponentially, with new measurement categories.
