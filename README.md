#  Quantity Measurement App  

## UC10 – Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface for Multi-Category Support  
---
**Date:** 21 Feb 2026  
---

## Overview  

UC10 is the final architectural refinement of the Quantity Measurement App.

It eliminates category-specific quantity classes and replaces them with a single, generic, type-safe `Quantity` implementation.

Earlier use cases (UC1–UC9) introduced separate classes such as `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight`.  
While functional, this design resulted in:

- Code duplication  
- Scalability limitations  
- Higher maintenance cost  

UC10 resolves these issues by introducing:

- A generic `Quantity<U>` class  
- A common `IMeasurable` interface implemented by all unit enums  
- Centralized logic for equality, conversion, and addition  

The system now supports multiple measurement categories without code duplication.

---

##  Objectives  

- Replace category-specific quantity classes with a generic implementation  
- Enforce type safety using Java generics  
- Standardize unit behavior using a common interface  
- Preserve all functionality from UC1–UC9  
- Prevent invalid cross-category comparisons  
- Enable effortless scalability for future categories  

---

##  Problems in UC9 (Why UC10 Exists)

### Duplicate Quantity Classes
- `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` contained identical logic  
- Bug fixes had to be repeated in multiple classes  

###  Duplicate Unit Patterns
- Length and Weight enums followed the same structure  
- Violated the DRY principle  

###  Poor Scalability
Each new category required:
- New unit enum  
- New quantity class  
- New application logic  
- New duplicated tests  

###  Maintenance Risk
- Logic divergence between categories  
- Higher probability of inconsistent behavior  

UC10 removes all of these issues.

---

##  Preconditions  

- UC1–UC9 functionality is complete and tested  
- Length and Weight units are implemented  
- Java Generics and immutability principles are applied  
- Base units are defined per category  

---

#  Design Introduced in UC10  

##  IMeasurable Interface  

Defines a common contract for all measurement units.

### Responsibilities:
- Provide conversion factor to base unit  
- Convert values to and from base unit  
- Expose unit name  

---

##  Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>  

A single generic class that replaces all category-specific quantity classes.

### Responsibilities:
- Hold value and unit  
- Perform conversion  
- Perform addition  
- Handle equality  
- Enforce category safety  
- Maintain immutability  

---

##  Unit Enums  

### LengthUnit  
- Base unit: FEET  

### WeightUnit  
- Base unit: KILOGRAM  

Each enum:
- Implements `IMeasurable`  
- Contains only conversion data  
- Provides parsing helpers for console input  

---

##  Main Flow  

1. User selects measurement category  
2. User enters values and units  
3. Application creates:
   - `Quantity<LengthUnit>`  
   - `Quantity<WeightUnit>`  
4. Operations performed:
   - Equality  
   - Conversion  
   - Addition  

All logic is handled by the generic `Quantity` class.

---

##  Supported Operations  

### Equality
- Same-unit equality  
- Cross-unit equality (same category)  
- Reflexive, symmetric, transitive  
- Cross-category comparison returns false  

### Conversion
- Any unit to any unit (within category)  
- Base-unit normalization ensures correctness  

### Addition
- Implicit target unit (first operand’s unit)  
- Explicit target unit supported  
- Returns a new immutable `Quantity`  

---

##  Type Safety & Category Protection  

- Compile-time safety via generics  
- Runtime checks prevent cross-category comparison  
- Length and Weight cannot be compared or added  

---

##  Testing Strategy  

UC10 introduces generic test coverage while preserving previous behavior.

### Test Coverage Includes:

- Length equality, conversion, addition  
- Weight equality, conversion, addition  
- Generic `Quantity` operations  
- Cross-category prevention  
- Immutability validation  
- Regression validation for UC1–UC9  

All tests pass using the generic `Quantity` class.

---

##  Design Principles Demonstrated  

- Single Responsibility Principle  
- Open–Closed Principle  
- DRY Principle  
- Immutability  
- Type Safety via Generics  
- High Scalability  

---

##  Extending the System  

To add a new measurement category:

1. Create a new enum implementing `IMeasurable`  
2. Define conversion factors  
3. Use `Quantity<NewUnit>`  

No changes required in:
- `Quantity` class  
- Application logic  
- Existing tests  

---

##  Conclusion  

UC10 transforms the Quantity Measurement App into a clean, scalable, production-ready architecture.

- Eliminates redundancy  
- Centralizes logic  
- Improves maintainability  
- Demonstrates advanced object-oriented design and generics mastery  

This use case represents the final architectural milestone of the project.
