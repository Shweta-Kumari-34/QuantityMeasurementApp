# Quantity Measurement App
## UC2 – Feet and Inches Measurement Equality

**Date:** 18 Feb 2026

## Overview
- This use case extends UC1 to support equality checks for both `Feet` and `Inches`.  
- The comparison is performed separately for each unit type. This use case does not compare feet with inches — they are treated independently.

### Objective
- Extend equality validation to include `Inches`.
- Maintain clean object-oriented equality logic.
- Ensure full test coverage for edge cases.

---

### Preconditions
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` class is instantiated.
- Two numerical values (feet or inches) are hard-coded for comparison.

---

### Main Flow
1. The `main` method calls a static method to validate two numerical values in **feet**.
2. The `main` method calls a static method to validate two numerical values in **inches**.
3. These static methods internally:
   - Instantiate `Feet` or `Inches` objects.
   - Call the overridden `equals()` method.
4. Both classes:
   - Validate input values.
   - Ensure values are numeric.
   - Compare measurements using `Double.compare()`.
5. The equality result (`true` / `false`) is returned to the user.

---

### Implementation Details
- Created a separate `Inches` class similar to `Feet`.
- Overrode `equals()` method in both classes.
- Implemented:
  - Reference check (`this == obj`)
  - `null` validation
  - Type checking
  - Safe casting
  - Floating-point comparison using `Double.compare()`
- Reduced dependency on the `main` method by defining separate validation methods.

---

### Example Execution
Input: `1.0 inch` and `1.0 inch`  
Output: `Equal (true)`

Input: `1.0 ft` and `1.0 ft`  
Output: `Equal (true)`

---

### Test Cases Implemented
- `testEquality_SameValue()`
- `testEquality_DifferentValue()`
- `testEquality_NullComparison()`
- `testEquality_NonNumericInput()`
- `testEquality_SameReference()`

Test cases ensure:
- Value-based equality
- Null safety
- Type safety
- Proper handling of floating-point values

---

### Concepts Learned
- Object Equality Contract
- Floating-point comparison best practices
- Null checking and type safety
- Encapsulation of measurement values
- Value-based equality design

---

### Design Limitation (Current Approach)
The current implementation violates the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle because:

- `Feet` and `Inches` classes contain nearly identical logic.
- Same constructor structure.
- Same `equals()` implementation.
- Same value validation logic.
This duplication increases maintenance effort and risk of inconsistency.

---

### Suggested Improvement
A better design would involve:

- Creating a generic `Quantity` class.
- Introducing a unit type parameter (e.g., `LengthUnit` enum).
- Centralizing equality logic in one reusable implementation.
This would improve scalability and maintainability for future unit conversions.

### 📌 Repository Updates
- Committed and pushed the UC2 implementation to the repository.
