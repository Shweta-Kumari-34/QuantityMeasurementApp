# Quantity Measurement App
## UC3 – Generic Quantity Class (Applying DRY Principle)
---
**Date:** 19 Feb 2026  
---

## Overview
UC3 refactors the Quantity Measurement App to eliminate code duplication introduced in UC1 and UC2.

Previously, separate classes such as `Feet` and `Inches` were used to represent different units of length. While functional, this design violated the **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principle because both classes contained nearly identical logic for:
- Construction
- Validation
- Equality comparison
UC3 introduces a **single generic `QuantityLength` class** backed by a `LengthUnit` enum, preserving all existing functionality while significantly improving maintainability and scalability.

---

## UC3 Objectives
- Eliminate duplication caused by unit-specific classes
- Introduce a unified representation for length measurements
- Enable cross-unit equality (e.g., `1 foot == 12 inches`)
- Preserve all behavior from UC1 and UC2
- Prepare the codebase for easy future extensions

---

## Changes Introduced in UC3
###  Removed
- `Feet` class  
- `Inches` class  

### Added
- `QuantityLength` – Generic class representing any length measurement  
- `LengthUnit` – Enum defining supported units and conversion factors  

---

## Design Improvements in UC3
###  Generic Quantity Model
`QuantityLength` encapsulates:
- Numeric value
- Unit type
- Conversion logic
- Equality comparison

Each object represents **value + unit together**, ensuring correctness and type safety.

---

###  Enum-Based Unit Handling
The `LengthUnit` enum:
- Defines supported units (`FEET`, `INCH`)
- Stores conversion factors
- Converts values to a common base unit

Enums eliminate magic strings and prevent invalid units at compile time.

---

###  Common Base Unit Conversion
All comparisons are performed by:
1. Converting values to a common base unit (inches)
2. Comparing the converted values using value-based equality
This enables accurate and consistent cross-unit equality.

---

## Supported Functionality
✔ Feet ↔ Feet equality  
✔ Inches ↔ Inches equality  
✔ Feet ↔ Inches equality  
✔ Same-reference equality  
✔ Null-safe comparison  
✔ Type-safe equality checks  

---

## Application Flow
1. User inputs two numeric values and their respective units.
2. Unit input is converted into a `LengthUnit` enum.
3. `QuantityLength` objects are created.
4. Values are internally converted to the base unit.
5. Equality is evaluated using value-based comparison.
6. Result (`true` / `false`) is displayed to the user.

---

## Testing Strategy
Test cases from UC1 and UC2 are conceptually preserved and adapted to the generic model.

### Tests Validate:
- Same-unit equality  
- Cross-unit equality  
- Inequality for different values  
- Null handling  
- Same-reference equality  
- Different-class comparison  

This confirms that refactoring did not break existing behavior.

---

## Key Concepts Applied
### DRY Principle
Eliminates duplicate logic and centralizes comparison behavior.

### Polymorphism
Single class handles multiple unit types via enum.

### Encapsulation
Value and unit are bundled together.

### Abstraction
Conversion logic is hidden from client code.

### Equality Contract
- Reflexive
- Symmetric
- Transitive
- Consistent
- Null-safe

### Scalability
Adding a new unit requires only adding a new enum constant — no changes to equality logic.

---

## Forward Compatibility
UC3 prepares the codebase for:
- Adding new units with minimal changes
- Implementing quantity arithmetic
- Extending comparison logic
- Scaling the system cleanly
