# UC13 – Centralized Arithmetic Logic to Enforce DRY in Quantity Operations
---
**Date:** 23 Feb 2026  
---

##  Description

UC13 refactors the arithmetic operations introduced in UC12 (`add`, `subtract`, `divide`) to eliminate code duplication
and enforce the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**.

Instead of repeating validation, conversion, and base-unit normalization logic across multiple methods,
UC13 introduces a **centralized private helper method** that encapsulates all shared arithmetic behavior.

 Public API remains unchanged  
 All UC12 tests pass without modification  
 Behavior remains 100% identical  
 Internal implementation is optimized  

---

#  Problems in UC12 Implementation

UC12 implemented arithmetic operations directly inside each method. This caused:

##  Code Duplication
- Same null checks repeated
- Same category validation repeated
- Same base-unit conversion repeated
- Same finiteness checks repeated
- Same target unit validation repeated

Future operations (multiply, modulo, etc.) would multiply duplication.

---

##  DRY Principle Violation
- Validation logic copied across methods
- Error messages not centralized
- Changes required in multiple places
- Risk of inconsistent behavior

---

##  Reduced Readability
Each arithmetic method looked like:

- Validation boilerplate
- Conversion boilerplate
- Actual arithmetic logic hidden at bottom

Intent was buried in repetitive code.

---

##  Scalability Issue
Adding new arithmetic operations would:
- Duplicate validation again
- Duplicate conversion again
- Increase maintenance complexity

---

#  Goal of UC13

- Centralize validation logic
- Centralize base-unit arithmetic logic
- Remove duplication
- Keep public API unchanged
- Preserve all UC12 behavior
- Improve maintainability
- Enable easy future extensions

---

#  Refactoring Strategy

---

## Step 1 – Create `ArithmeticOperation` Enum

Two approaches supported:

###  Approach 1 – Abstract Method (Clean & Scalable)

Each enum constant implements:

```
compute(double left, double right)
```

Example operations:
- ADD
- SUBTRACT
- DIVIDE
- MULTIPLY (future-ready)

This keeps operation logic tied directly to enum constants.

---

###  Approach 2 – Lambda Expression (Modern & Concise)

Uses `DoubleBinaryOperator`.

Each enum constant defines:

```
(a, b) -> a + b
```

Cleaner for small logic, less ideal for complex logic.

---

#  Step 2 – Centralized Validation Helper

### Private Method:

```
validateArithmeticOperands(Quantity<U> other, U targetUnit, boolean targetUnitRequired)
```

### Validates:
- Null operand
- Cross-category units
- Finiteness (NaN, Infinity)
- Target unit (if required)

All validation logic now lives in ONE place.

---

#  Step 3 – Core Arithmetic Helper

### Private Method:

```
performBaseArithmetic(Quantity<U> other, ArithmeticOperation operation)
```

### Responsibilities:
- Convert `this` to base unit
- Convert `other` to base unit
- Perform operation using enum
- Return base-unit result

No validation duplication.
No conversion duplication.

---

#  Step 4 – Refactor Public Methods

## add()
- Calls validation helper
- Calls performBaseArithmetic(ADD)
- Converts result to target unit
- Returns new Quantity

## subtract()
- Same flow
- Uses SUBTRACT enum

## divide()
- Calls helper with DIVIDE
- Returns dimensionless scalar

Public signatures unchanged.

---

#  Internal Flow Example

```
q1.subtract(q2, FEET)

↓
validateArithmeticOperands(q2, FEET, true)

↓
performBaseArithmetic(q2, SUBTRACT)

↓
SUBTRACT.compute(base1, base2)

↓
Convert result to FEET

↓
Return new Quantity<>(value, FEET)
```

---

#  Postconditions

- All arithmetic operations delegate to centralized helper
- Validation logic written once
- Conversion logic written once
- No duplicated code remains
- All UC12 tests pass
- Public API unchanged
- DRY principle enforced
- Maintainability improved
- Future operations easy to add

---

#  Concepts Learned

---

##  DRY Principle
Common logic extracted into helper methods.

---

##  Lambda Expressions
Anonymous functions:
```
(a, b) -> a + b
```

Introduced in Java 8 for functional programming.

---

##  Functional Interface

`DoubleBinaryOperator`

Takes:
```
double, double → returns double
```

Compiler matches lambda automatically.

---

##  Enum-Based Operation Dispatch

Cleaner than:
- if-else chains
- switch statements

Type-safe and extensible.

---

##  Separation of Concerns

Public methods:
- Maintain API consistency

Private helpers:
- Handle validation
- Handle conversion
- Handle computation

---

##  Encapsulation

Helper methods are private.
Implementation hidden from users.

---

##  Refactoring Without Behavior Change

Internal improvement.
External behavior identical.
Regression-free refactor.

---

# Key Test Coverage

### Validation Consistency
- Null operand rejected
- Cross-category rejected
- Non-finite values rejected

### Enum Dispatch
- ADD computes correctly
- SUBTRACT computes correctly
- DIVIDE computes correctly

### Backward Compatibility
- All UC12 tests pass unchanged

### Rounding Behavior
- Add/Subtract rounded to 2 decimals
- Divide returns raw double

### Immutability
- Original objects unchanged
- New objects returned

### Helper Delegation
- add → ADD enum
- subtract → SUBTRACT enum
- divide → DIVIDE enum

### DRY Enforcement
- Validation appears once
- Conversion appears once

---

# Scalability Proof

To add multiplication:
1. Add MULTIPLY in enum
2. Public multiply() calls helper
3. No validation duplication
4. No conversion duplication

System scales cleanly.

---

#  Conclusion

UC13 transforms the arithmetic implementation into:

- Cleaner
- More maintainable
- DRY-compliant
- Future-proof
- Architecturally strong

It is a pure refactoring use case:
**Improved design without changing behavior.**
